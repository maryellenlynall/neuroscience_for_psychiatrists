# neuroscience_for_psychiatrists

This respository exists to collect feedback and suggestions on The Cambridge Textbook of Neuroscience for Psychiatrists 2023, Cambridge University Press, edited by Mary-Ellen Lynall, Peter Jones and Stephen Stahl. 

We'd love to hear feedback on:

- Any questions about neuroscience that come up in psychiatric clinical practise and haven't been addressed in the book I.e. 'Why does X happen? What's the neuroscience of Y?
- Any other topics you'd like to see addressed
- Any errors or typos
- Anything that was particularly helpful or you would like to see more of in future editions
